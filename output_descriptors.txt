2020_08_08_13_42_38 - Best returns, down to -2.5. Only using Laux_demo. However, Linfo is high and Laux is high which means it might not be that generalisable/adaptable.
2020_08_08_18_26_12 - Returns down to -4. But really good Linfo of 0.5 and compromise between Laux and Laux_demo which means it is probably more generalisable.
